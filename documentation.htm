standered [Excel]. This is an updated version of my previous work, now complete 
Events, Properties, Documentation and even more options! Fuly optimized and 
commented. All bugs fixed. A must have for any database devoloper and a must add

In the General Declaration section type:<br>
Private WithEvents export as DatabaseExport<br>
<br>
Then in the Form_Load() Event or in any place but just before the class will be 
used, type:<br>
Set export = New DatabaseExport<br>
<br>
Now use the Class as you wish. But remember to clear up this reference in the 
Form_Unload() Event or anyplace after the use of the Class:<br>
Set export = Nothing<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="4" color="#FF0000">Enumerated Constants (Enums)</font></p>
<p><b>DatabaseExportEnum</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [CSV] = 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [HTML] = 1<br>

<p><br>
<font size="4" face="Tahoma" color="#FF0000">The Properties</font><br>
<br>
<b>ProgressBar:</b> Bind a progressbar to the class to show the progress of the 
Export. Remarks: Error is generated if no progressbar is bound.<br>
<b>ADORecordset:</b> Binds a recordset to the class. This is the class that will 
be exported.<br>
<b>FilePath:</b> This is the string to which the file will be exported. Error 
Remarks: This one is optional for exporting in Excel.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Tahoma">The Methods</font><b><br>
</b><br>
<b>ExportToCSV:</b> Exports the given recordsets to Comma Separated Values or 
CSV. CSV can be read by almost any Database and Spreadsheet Program.<br>
<i>Remarks: If you have MSExcel, you can use it to open the CSV file and see the 
difference between the CSV and the same recordset exported to Excel.</i></p>
<p><b>ExportToHTML:</b> Exports the given recordset to HTML file so it can 
easily be uploaded to the<br>
internet or viewed from the intranet. Many options are in this method to make<br>
customizability easier.<br>
<i>Remarks: You can use this Format to any platform, because all computers 
nowadays have a browser. This will be the best option if you don't know your 
client.</i><br>
<br>
<b>ExportToExcel:</b> Exports the given recordset to Microsoft Excel. Excel 
provides almost unlimited
control for the user over the recordset and you s/he can it to easily compute
or make graphs from the Excel.<br>
<font face="Fixedsys">Notes on usage</font>: If you do not have Excel 10.0 
originally used to write the program then simply remove reference from Excel 
10.0 and select your version. If you do not have Excel at all, then simply do 
not use the subroutines related to Excel.<br>
<i>Remarks: To use this method, the user must have MSExcel or Excel.exe An 
advantage of exporting to Excel is that after this, the user can use Excel to 
Export to other formats (from Save As.. Menu)</i><br>
<br>
<b>OpenRecordset</b>: This method is not related to exporting. However this will 
open a recordset from a database without much hastel and saves a few keystrokes. 
The default options used to open the recordset is the fastest and recommended 
when exporting.<br>
<i>Remarks: The Query Parameter must start with &quot;WHERE &quot;</i><br>
<br>
<b>ShowSave</b>: Use this method and it's options to show a save as... Dialog 
Box easily. This function is not really required to be used, however it is much 
easier and reduces coding.<br>
Returns: True if a file is saved. False if cancelled or if file path is null 
string.<br>
<br>
<font face="Tahoma" size="4" color="#FF0000">The Events</font><br>
<br>
<b>Event ExportError (Error As ErrObject)</b><br>
Raised whenever an error is generated. use it to catch an error. To ignore 
errors, just type Error.Clear<br>
<br>
<b>Event ExportStarted (ByVal ExportingFormat As DatabaseExportEnum)</b><br>
Raised whenever Exporting Starts. This event is raised first, before any code is 
executed.<br>
<br>
<b>Event ExportComplete (ByVal Success As Boolean, ByVal ExportingFormat As 
DatabaseExportEnum)</b><br>
Raised whenever exporting is completed. However, this is not called if an error 
was NOT ignored. If an error was ignored Success returns False else True.<br>

kind, but I am just a ninth grader. Your votes and feedback will encorage me to 
improve and present you with better programs in the years to come.</i></p>
